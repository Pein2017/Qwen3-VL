# Tasks: Add GRPO Batch Plan Shorthand

- [x] Add schema support for `custom.grpo.batch_plan` (dataclass + validation) in `src/config/schema.py`.
- [x] Implement shorthand expansion in `ConfigLoader.load_yaml_with_extends()` so resolved configs contain:
  - `training.per_device_train_batch_size`
  - `training.per_device_eval_batch_size`
  - `training.effective_batch_size`
  - `rlhf.generation_batch_size`
  - `custom.extra.rollout_server` populated/enforced for TP/DP/max_num_seqs when rollout_server plan is provided (fail fast if conflicting).
- [x] Implement strict conflict detection with actionable errors when shorthand is enabled but legacy knobs disagree.
- [x] Implement world-size-aware validation ensuring `gradient_accumulation_steps == steps_per_generation`:
  - validate `unified_batch_size % (per_device_train_batch_size * world_size) == 0` when `WORLD_SIZE` is available.
- [x] Add tests under `tests/rlhf/grpo/`:
  - [x] Shorthand expands correctly for a synthetic config.
  - [x] Conflicting legacy knobs fail fast.
  - [x] World-size divisibility validation works by setting `WORLD_SIZE` in the test environment.
  - [x] Rollout server config extracted via `extract_rollout_server_launch_config` uses forced TP/DP/max_num_seqs.
- [x] Add a training startup log line (rank0) summarizing:
  - world_size, per_device_train_batch_size, per_device_eval_batch_size, unified_batch_size
  - derived `gradient_accumulation_steps` and derived `steps_per_generation` (when world size is known)
  - rollout server TP/DP/max_num_seqs when forced via the plan
- [x] Update docs:
  - [x] `docs/training/GRPO_MS_SWIFT_PIPELINE.md` add a “Batch Plan Shorthand” section with an intuitive example.
  - [x] Add a short cross-reference in `docs/training/REFERENCE.md` pointing to the new shorthand section.
  - [x] Mention how to inspect the resolved config via `scripts/config_tools/inspect_config.py`.
- [x] Update at least one GRPO preset to demonstrate the new shorthand interface.
- [x] Run `pytest -q` (or at least the GRPO config tests) and ensure no regressions.
