- [ ] Add capability spec delta for hard-sample mining (requirements + scenarios).
- [ ] Extend config schema to parse `custom.hard_sample_mining` with validation and defaults.
- [ ] Add stable sample identifiers to datasets and expose metadata needed for mining.
- [ ] Implement loss tracking + hard-sample selection (trainer wrapper + callback) and persist state across epochs.
- [ ] Update dataset scheduling/permutation to honor hard-sample weights without changing epoch length.
- [ ] Wire feature in `src/sft.py` (config plumbing, callback registration) with safe defaults.
- [ ] Update docs (training playbook and fusion dataset sections) with usage and caveats.
- [ ] Add quick validation/smoke test or debug hook to verify mining trigger and sample weighting.
