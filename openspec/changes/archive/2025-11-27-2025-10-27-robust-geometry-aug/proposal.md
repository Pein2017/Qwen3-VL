# Change: 2025-10-27-robust-geometry-aug

## Why
Core affine/geometry guarantees for augmentation were implemented and are already live in `src/datasets/geometry.py` and `src/datasets/augmentation/*` (see commits around late October). The change was left open only to archive its deltas.

## What Changes
- Formalize the completed geometry-robustness work as a recorded change.
- Archive without updating specs (they were already updated by later changes).

## Impact
- No code/spec deltas; bookkeeping only to keep `openspec list` clean.
