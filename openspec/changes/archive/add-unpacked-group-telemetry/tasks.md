- [ ] Add collator shim path that injects per-sample dataset labels + single-item segment lengths for padded batches when `packing=false`, leaving standard padding intact.
- [ ] Keep `GroupedMetricsMixin` active without packing so it logs only `{dataset}_loss` and `{dataset}_token_acc` from those labels/lengths.
- [ ] Derive dataset labels from metadata (`_fusion_source` → `dataset_name`) with no extra grouping key; treat domain mapping as target-by-default and gate source eval on presence of a `val` path.
- [ ] Add unit/integ test covering non-packed per-dataset metrics (train) and target-only eval, plus source eval when a `val` path is provided.
- [ ] Update documentation (docs/training/REFERENCE.md and TRAINING_PLAYBOOK.md) to explain the default-on behavior when packing is off, metric names, and how eval gating follows `val` paths.
- [ ] Run `openspec validate add-unpacked-group-telemetry --strict`.
