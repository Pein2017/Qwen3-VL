- [x] Spec updates: add deltas for detection-preprocessor and stage-b-training-free to reject review placeholders instead of sanitizing them.
- [x] Data conversion: remove review_flagger flow; make converters/validators fail on review markers; regenerate any shipped sample JSONL and update `docs/data` accordingly.
- [x] Stage-A/Stage-B prompts: strip references in prompt templates and message builders; ensure prompt instructions remain binary-only.
- [x] Docs: refresh data/training/runtime/prompt references (e.g., `technical_report.md`, `docs/data/DATA_AND_DATASETS.md`, `docs/runtime/STAGE_B_RUNTIME.md`, `docs/reference/stage-B-knowledge-Chinese.md`).
- [x] Cleanup analysis artifacts or move them to an archive path so tracked files no longer contain the key.
