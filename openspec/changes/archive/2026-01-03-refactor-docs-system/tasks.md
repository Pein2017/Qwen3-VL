# Tasks: Refactor Documentation System

- [x] Create a complete inventory of `docs/` files and current cross-links.
- [x] Define the target information architecture (directories, naming, and ownership map).
- [x] Draft the standard doc template (front-matter/header fields and section order).
- [x] Audit and update each `docs/` file in sequence against `src/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, and related code.
- [x] Remove or rewrite outdated sections in-place; eliminate draft-only content.
- [x] Reorganize files to match the new architecture and update all internal references.
- [x] Refresh `docs/README.md` to be the authoritative index and navigation hub.
- [x] Verify that no broken internal links remain after reorganization.
- [x] Record an audit log (file-by-file checklist) to ensure no docs are missed.
