# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

## Qwen3‑VL quick brief
- Single repo: ms‑swift orchestrated dense-caption training under `/data/Qwen3-VL`.
- Configuration-first: edit YAML in `configs/`, consumption handled by `src/sft.py` and helpers.
- Canonical references:
  - Global guide: `/data/Qwen3-VL/AGENTS.md`
  - Feature workflow: `openspec/AGENTS.md`, `openspec/project.md`
  - Augmentation/geometry: `docs/AUGMENTATION.md`, `compare/.../final_analysis.md`
  - Launch scripts: `scripts/train.sh`, `python -m src.sft`
  - Visualization: `vis_tools/vis_augment_compare.py`, `vis_qwen3.py`

## Working notes
- Prefer ms‑swift/transformers primitives; keep custom code minimal.
- Changes touching augmentation/geometry should include visualization or tests.
- For new capabilities follow the OpenSpec proposal → tasks → validation flow.
